# Alternative implementations
- https://github.com/phpbench/phpbench/blob/master/lib/Benchmark/CartesianParameterIterator.php : A little bit more messy.
- https://github.com/bpolaszek/cartesian-product : Not so laconic - but covered by tested.
- https://stackoverflow.com/a/15973172 : Pretty simple though no iterator, plain array-stuff.
